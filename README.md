Hello!!

This project originated by following the React Tic Tac Toe tutorial in order to get an understanding of the framework. ([found here](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe))

I've expanded on this slightly by adding a few features in order to continue learning and get some practice using hooks and managing state.

~~No additional styling was added because I was purely focusing on the functionality and learning React features.~~

update: some styling added! just enough to not make my eyes bleed.

Have a great day!
